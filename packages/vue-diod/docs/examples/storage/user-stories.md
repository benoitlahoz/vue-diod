title: User Stories

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

To define the functionalities we'll have to create, we write user stories,
based on a `Client` entity corresponding to the end user (the one with the page
opened in her browser).

## Store

- **US1**: As a `Client` I want to store data in **my browser** for this page
  to get it back later.

- **US2**: As a `Client` I want to get data already stored for the application
  I'm running and read its value.

- **US3**: As a `Client` I want to be able to remove some of the data stored.

- **US4**: As a `Client` I want to now if the data stored is a `string`
  or a `number`.

- **US5**: As a `Client` I want the data stored to be displayed in real-time.

## Save

- **US6**: As a `Client` I want to be able to download a file containing the
  data stored to use it locally.

- **US7**: As a `Client` I want the saved file to be timestamped to stay
  organized with my different versions.
